# Security Protocols and Standards

## Overview
This document outlines the security protocols, standards, and best practices for the Safety and Defense Software project.

## Access Control

### Authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all users
- Strong password policies enforced
- Session management with automatic timeout
- Account lockout after failed attempts

### Authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews and audits
- Separation of duties

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- AES-256-GCM for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Key management with hardware security modules (HSM)
- Regular key rotation

### Data Classification
1. **PUBLIC** - Non-sensitive information
2. **INTERNAL** - Company internal use
3. **CONFIDENTIAL** - Sensitive business information
4. **SECRET** - Highly sensitive information
5. **TOP_SECRET** - Critical national security information

## Network Security

### Perimeter Security
- Firewall protection
- Intrusion detection/prevention systems
- VPN access required for remote work
- Network segmentation

### Monitoring
- Real-time network monitoring
- Anomaly detection
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Incident response procedures

## Incident Response

### Response Levels
- **Level 1** - Automated response
- **Level 2** - Security team response
- **Level 3** - Management escalation
- **Level 4** - Executive notification

### Containment Procedures
