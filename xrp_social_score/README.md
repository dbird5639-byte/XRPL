## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/xrp-health-platform.git
cd xrp-health-platform

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python examples/demo_platform.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from xrp_health_platform import HealthScorer, CitizenCoinSystem, XRPLedgerIntegration

# Initialize the platform
health_scorer = HealthScorer()
coin_system = CitizenCoinSystem()
xrp_integration = XRPLedgerIntegration()

# Create a user profile
user = UserProfile(
    user_id="user_123",
    xrp_address="rYourXRPAddress123456789",
    created_at=datetime.now(),
    last_updated=datetime.now(),
    username="crypto_enthusiast",
    email="user@example.com"
)

# Add activities
activity = ActivityRecord(
    activity_id="activity_001",
    user_id="user_123",
    activity_type=ActivityType.XRP_TRANSACTION,
    timestamp=datetime.now(),
    description="XRP transaction",
    value=100.0,
    verified=True
)

# Calculate health score
health_score = health_scorer.calculate_health_score(user)

# Calculate citizen coin rewards
coin_rewards = coin_system.calculate_activity_rewards(activity)

print(f"Health Score: {health_score.total_score:.1f}")
print(f"Citizen Coins: {coin_rewards}")
```
